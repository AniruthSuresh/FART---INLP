# FART---INLP
Repo to maintain all the codes for INLP Project

This repo contains the code for [FFT-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18394) : an adaptive spectral filtering
framework that leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve global token
mixing in O(n log n) time. By transforming inputs into the frequency domain,
FFTNet **exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation guaranteed by Parse-
valâ€™s theorem** to capture long-range dependencies efficientl
